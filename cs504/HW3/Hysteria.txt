It is bugging me
Grating me
And twisting me around
Yeah I am endlessly
Caving in
And turning inside out
Because I want it now
I want it now
Give me your heart and your soul
And I am breaking out
I am breaking out
Last chance to lose control
Yeah it is holding me
Morphing me
And forcing me to strive
To be endlessly
Caving in
And dreaming I am alive
Because I want it now
I want it now
Give me your heart and your soul
I am not breaking down
I am breaking out
Last chance to lose control
And I want you now
I want you now
I feel my heart implode
And I am breaking out
Escaping now
Feeling my faith erode
