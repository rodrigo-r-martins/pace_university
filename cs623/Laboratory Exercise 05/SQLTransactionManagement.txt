-- (a) using rollback and commit

select * from student;

update student 
set credits =credits + 10;

select * from student;

rollback;

select * from student;

commit;

select * from student;
/

-- (b) using savepoints

update student 
set credits = credits + 10;

select * from student; 

savepoint added_10;

update student set major = 'CSC';

select * from student;

-- roll back to last savepoint
rollback to savepoint added_10;  

select * from student;

-- roll back to beginning of transaction
rollback;  

select * from student;

commit;
/


-- (c) using SET TRANSACTION and naming transactions

SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY NAME 'TRANSTEST';

SELECT lastname, credits
FROM student
order by lastname;

COMMIT;

-- the following generates an error because it attempts to write in a read-only transaction

SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY NAME 'TRANSTEST2';

SELECT lastname, credits
FROM student
order by lastname;

UPDATE student
SET credits = credits +10;

COMMIT;


--  to allow writing we make it READ WRITE

SET TRANSACTION READ WRITE NAME 'TRANSTEST3';

SELECT lastname, credits
FROM student
order by lastname;

UPDATE student
SET credits = credits +10;

SELECT stuid, credits
FROM student;

ROLLBACK;

SELECT stuid, credits
FROM student;
